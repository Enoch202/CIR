## Introduction

We investigate **Code-Integrated Reasoning**, a approach where models generate and execute code during reasoning to enhance performance, particularly in complex mathematical tasks.

üîç **Challenges & Strategies**: We analyze the challenges in tool-augmented RL, such as instability and lack of exploration, and propose strategies that balance exploration and stability. These include progressively increasing the tool interaction budget, precisely matching the interaction boundaries and masking the external feedback.

üìà **Performance**: Our method demonstrates substantial performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks with an average accuracy of 52.4%, surpassing several competitive baselines.

üí° **Mechanistic Insights**: We further provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms behind code-integrated reasoning, explaining why and how it is effective.

* Capability Expansion: Code integration significantly extends the model‚Äôs capability boundaries, enhancing performance on complex tasks.

* Efficiency: It produces more concise and efficient reasoning paths compared to traditional long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) methods.
* Error Feedback: Non-executable code generates informative error feedback, compelling the model to reflect and revise, ultimately improving accuracy.
* Selective Benefits: While highly effective for algebra, number theory, and combinatorics, code integration shows minimal impact on geometry problems.
